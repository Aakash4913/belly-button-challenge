# belly-button-challenge

In this challenge, I made charts of the different type of belly button bacteria and how often different microbes "colonize" navels.  I used the D3 library to read in samples.json from the url https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

I created a horizontal bar, a bubble chart for the Operational Taxonomic Units(OTU), I also created a key value pair that identifies each data point and put a chart for each with a drop down menu where you get to select each data point.  

Lastly I created a gauge chart that tells how many times each person scrubbed their bellybutton in a given week on average.
